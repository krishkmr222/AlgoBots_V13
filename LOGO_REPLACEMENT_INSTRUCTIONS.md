## Remaining Task: Logo Image Replacement

### Current Logo File
- **Location**: `/app/static/favicon/algobots-modern-logo.svg`
- **Current Design**: Simple "A" lettermark with green-to-cyan gradient
- **Size**: 48x48px viewBox, scalable SVG

### How to Replace the Logo

1. **Prepare Your New Logo**:
   - **Recommended Format**: SVG (for scalability)
   - **Alternative Formats**: PNG (high resolution, transparent background)
   - **Dimensions**: Square aspect ratio recommended (will be displayed at 40x40px)
   - **Background**: Transparent or works well on dark themes

2. **Replace the File**:
   ```bash
   # Backup current logo (optional)
   cp /app/static/favicon/algobots-modern-logo.svg /app/static/favicon/algobots-modern-logo-backup.svg
   
   # Replace with your new logo
   cp /path/to/your/new-logo.svg /app/static/favicon/algobots-modern-logo.svg
   ```

3. **If Using Different Format** (PNG/JPG):
   - Update the file references in templates:
     - `/app/templates/navbar.html` - Line 11
     - `/app/templates/public_navbar.html` - Line 10  
     - `/app/templates/footer.html` - Line 10
     - `/app/templates/base.html` - Line 126
     - `/app/templates/layout.html` - Line 91

### Files That Reference the Logo

1. **Header Navigation** (Authenticated Users):
   - `/app/templates/navbar.html` - Line 11

2. **Public Navigation**:
   - `/app/templates/public_navbar.html` - Line 10

3. **Footer**:
   - `/app/templates/footer.html` - Line 10

4. **Mobile Sidebar**:
   - `/app/templates/base.html` - Line 126
   - `/app/templates/layout.html` - Line 91

### Logo Display Specifications

- **Desktop Header**: 40x40px with text beside it
- **Mobile Header**: 40x40px, text hidden on very small screens  
- **Footer**: 48x48px with text beside it
- **Mobile Sidebar**: 40x40px with text beside it

### Testing After Replacement
